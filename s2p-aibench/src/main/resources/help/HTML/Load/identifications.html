	<h1>Load Mascot identifications <img src="../Images/Toolbar/load-identifications-button.png"/></h1>
	<p>This operation allows you to load Mascot identifications from a CSV file.</p>
	<p><strong>Mascot identifications CSV file</strong></p>
	<p>This option allows you to load Mascot identifications from a CSV file. This CSV file must have the same format that the one used by the <i>Mascot identifications table</i> to store the data.</p>
	<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
	<p>You can execute this operation by clicking the menu option <i>Load/Load Mascot identifications</i> or the toolbar <img src="../Images/Toolbar/load-identifications-button.png"/> button.</p>
	<p>A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the CSV file containing the Mascot identifications and other parameters to filter the identifications to be loaded. As you can see in the following image, this dialog requires you to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Protein identifications</b>: a HTM file containing the Mascot report.</li>
		<li><b>CSV format</b>: the CSV format of the selected CSV file. <i>S2P</i> includes two preconfigured formats for Excel and Open/LibreOffice applications. In case you need to specify a custom CSV format you can select the Custom option, which allows you to configure the CSV format.</li>
		<li><b>Minimum Mascot Score</b>: the minimum Mascot Score for identifications to be loaded. Entries within a lower Mascot Score are not loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Remove duplicates</b>: whether duplicated identifications must be skipped. Check this option to remove duplicated identifications.</li>
	</ul>
	<div align="center">
  		<p><img src="../Images/Dialogs/load-mascot-identifications.png" border="0"/></p>
  		<p><strong><i>Load Mascot identifications</i> dialog</strong></p>
	</div>
	<p>As commented above, you can customize the CSV format by selecting the <i>Custom</i> format option. When you select this option, the following custom format panel will be shown in the dialog. The options included in this panel will allow you to customize the CSV format:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Quote fields</b>: if this option is selected, then all fields will be quoted in the resulting CSV file.</li>
		<li><b>Column separator</b>: the separator character/s between columns.</li>
		<li><b>Decimal separator</b>: the character to use as decimal separator. Note that the decimal separator should be different from the column separator; otherwise, it may result in an unreadable CSV file.</li>
		<li><b>Line break</b>: the type of line break depending in the target operating system.</li>
	</ul>
	<div align="center">
  		<p><img src="../Images/Dialogs/csv-custom-format.png" border="0"/></p>
  		<p><strong><i>Custom CSV</i> panel</strong></p>
	</div>
	<p>After clicking the <i>Ok</i> button, the loaded Mascot identifications are added as a <a href="../Datatypes/mascot-identifications.html"><i>Mascot identifications</i> datatype</a> to the clipboard and automatically opened in the <i>Mascot identifications table</i>.</p>
