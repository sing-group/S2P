	<p>This operation allows you to import Mascot identifications from a HTM Mascot report file.</p>
	<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
	<p>You can execute this operation by clicking the menu option <i>Import/Import Mascot identifications</i>.</p>
	<p>A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the file containing the report and other parameters to filter the identifications to be loaded. As you can see in the following image, this dialog requires you to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Protein identifications</b>: a HTM file containing the Mascot report.</li>
		<li><b>Minimum Mascot Score</b>: the minimum Mascot Score for identifications to be loaded. Entries within a lower Mascot Score are not loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Remove duplicates</b>: whether duplicated identifications must be skipped. Check this option to remove duplicated identifications.</li>
	</ul>

  		<p><strong><i>Import Mascot identifications</i> dialog</strong></p>
	</div>
	<p>After clicking the <i>Ok</i> button, the imported Mascot identifications are added as a <a href="../Datatypes/mascot-identifications.html"><i>Mascot identifications</i> datatype</a> to the clipboard and automatically opened in the <i>Mascot identifications table</i>.</p>
