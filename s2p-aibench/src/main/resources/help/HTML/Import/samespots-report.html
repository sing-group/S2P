	<h1>Import SameSpots report</h1>
	<p>This operation allows you to import a <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i> report from the generated HTM files.</p>
	<p><strong>SameSpots report format</strong></p>
	<p>This option allows you to import data from a <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i> report (i.e. one or more HTM files). This report is generated by the <i>Export report</i> option of this software. <i>S2P</i> only accepts reports from pairwise comparisons experiments. For further details on this format, please, check the sample data provided with the tutorial that can be found at the official webpage.</p>
	<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
	<p>You can execute this operation by clicking the menu option <i>Import/SameSpots/Import report</i>.</p>
	<p>A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the directory containing the report files and other parameters to filter the spots to be loaded. As you can see in the following image, this dialog requires you to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SameSpots report directory</b>: the directory containing the HTM files generated by the <i>Protenesis SameSpots</i> software. Please, note that you must select a directory and not the individual files.</li>
		<li><b>p-value</b>: the maximum p-value allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a higher p-value will not be loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Fold</b>: the minimum fold allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a lower fold will not be loaded.</li>
	</ul>

	</div>
	<p>After clicking the <i>Ok</i> button, the imported spots data is added as a <a href="../Datatypes/samespots-analysis.html"><i>SameSpots analysis</i> datatype</a> to the clipboard and automatically opened in the <i>SameSpots analysis editor</i>.</p>
