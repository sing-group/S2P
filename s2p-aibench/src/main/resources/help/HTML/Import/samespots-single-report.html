	<h1>Import a single HTM SameSpots report</h1>
	<p>This operation allows you to import a single <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i> report from the generated HTM file.</p>
	<p><strong>SameSpots report format</strong></p>
	<p>This option allows you to import data from a single <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i> report (i.e. one HTM file). This report is generated by the <i>Export report</i> option of this software. For further details on this format, please, check the sample data provided with the tutorial that can be found at the official webpage.</p>
	<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
	<p>You can execute this operation by clicking the menu option <i>Import/SameSpots/Single HTM report</i>.</p>
	<p>A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the HTM report file and other parameters to filter the spots to be loaded. As you can see in the following image, this dialog requires you to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SameSpots report file</b>: the HTM file report generated by the <i>Protenesis SameSpots</i> software. Please, note that you must select a file and not a directory.</li>
		<li><b>p-value</b>: the maximum p-value allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a higher p-value will not be loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Fold</b>: the minimum fold allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a lower fold will not be loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Spots suffix</b>: the suffix to add to the spots identifiers.</li>
	</ul>

  		<p><strong><i>Import SameSpots single report</i> dialog</strong></p>
	</div>
	<p>After clicking the <i>Ok</i> button, the imported spots data is added as a <a href="../Datatypes/samespots-analysis.html"><i>SameSpots analysis</i> datatype</a> to the clipboard and automatically opened in the <i>SameSpots analysis editor</i>.</p>
