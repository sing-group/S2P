	<h1>Import SameSpots CSV files</h1>
	<p>This operation allows you to import a set of CSV files containing spots data obtained with <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i>.</p>
	<p><strong>SameSpots CSV format</strong></p>
	<p>This option allows you to import spots data from a set of CSV files obtained with <i>Progenesis SameSpots</i> report (i.e. one or more CSV files). This files are obtained by using the <i>File/Export spot measurements</i> option of this software, exporting only spot number, p-value, fold, normalized Volume and volume. For further details on this format, please, check the sample data provided with the tutorial that can be found at the official webpage.</p>
	<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
	<p>You can execute this operation by clicking the menu option <i>Import/SameSpots/Import CSV</i>.</p>
	<p>A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the directory containing the CSV files and other parameters to filter the identifications to be loaded. As you can see in the following image, this dialog requires you to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SameSpots CSV directory</b>: the directory containing the CSV files generated by the <i>Protenesis SameSpots</i> software. Please, note that you must select a directory and not the individual files.</li>
		<li><b>p-value</b>: the maximum p-value allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a higher p-value will not be loaded.</li>
		<li><b>Fold</b>: the minimum fold allowed for spots to be loaded. Spots within a lower fold will not be loaded.</li>
		<li><b>CSV format</b>: the CSV format of the CSV files. <i>S2P</i> includes two preconfigured formats for Excel and Open/LibreOffice applications. In case you need to specify a custom CSV format you can select the Custom option, which allows you to configure the CSV format.</li>
	</ul>

  		<p><strong><i>Import SameSpots CSV</i> dialog</strong></p>
	</div>
	<p>As commented above, you can customize the CSV format by selecting the <i>Custom</i> format option. When you select this option, the following custom format panel will be shown in the dialog. The options included in this panel will allow you to customize the CSV format:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Quote fields</b>: if this option is selected, then all fields will be quoted in the resulting CSV file.</li>
		<li><b>Column separator</b>: the separator character/s between columns.</li>
		<li><b>Decimal separator</b>: the character to use as decimal separator. Note that the decimal separator should be different from the column separator; otherwise, it may result in an unreadable CSV file.</li>
		<li><b>Line break</b>: the type of line break depending in the target operating system.</li>
	</ul>
